# Aws_Serverless_Express

# It is well configured and tested aws serverless express frame work code.
# which is just like old express codes.

# First step would be npm i
# And then deploy the code into aws by "serverless deploy"    [Before this install serverless and configure aws with your system]

# aws will give you server addresses and configure lambda and api gateway for you
